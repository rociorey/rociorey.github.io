      <h1> Unit 8 reflection </h1>
      <h3> Introduction </h3>
      <article>
      <p> <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/887860/mod_resource/content/2/Brief%201%20Equivalence_v2%202020.pdf">Unit 7’s first brief </a href> was all about equivalences. Choosing to use a 16mm Bolex camera, my group decided to explore the theme of “deja vu”. Through the use of mirrors and reflections as the representation of a person, we focused on the confusion part of the phenomenon, leaving the narrative in the video unresolved. Although my group worked well together and the video turned out nicely in the end, this project raised some interesting questions and created some revelations in terms of where I want to take my practice. During the project I discovered I’m very keen on the cinematography side of filmmaking. Working on the visuals of our video was probably one of the things which excited me the most. Another one was my focus on the concept. For me to be fully engaged with work I’m creating, I need to have a very clear and strong concept which drives meaning. Lastly, I realised interaction is a key point which makes me enjoy work. When my group was discussing how to convey the equivalence we had chosen, deja vu, I was very keen on transcending the screen and making the audience have a deja vu, since I had read some articles on the possibility of this. Interaction with the audience and their place within my work is clearly something I tend to feel drawn towards.

      <h3> Fluxus and my practice </h3>
      <p>Fluxus, an art movement from the 60’s, is very keen on this. Although a hard movement to describe since not even its practitioners could come up with a collective description, it's a key concept which helped to develop nowadays’ interactive design field. The book ‘Fluxus. The practice of non-duality’ by Natasha Lushetich helped me to understand the features and values of this movement. <h4> Multiplicity, interactivity, playfulness </h4> Multiplicity, interactivity, playfulness, merge of art and daily life and globalism are some of the words Fluxus engages with. Its works are keen on the disappearance of the creator and consumer, and consider the creations aren't finalised until the interaction occurs. Discovering this movement and engaging with their ongoing conversations has allowed me to realise I feel more passionate about interactive outcomes over ones where the audience is completely passive, I prefer projects which engage in the everyday life instead of a space like a museum or gallery and that I am interested in the idea of creating or tweaking daily objects and experiences into ones which bring new perspectives or are more meaningful.
Nam June Paik, a Fluxus artist, conveyed all these ideas and conversations in his work. He popularised the use of video in art, creating experimental, playful and interactive pieces. Attending to the current Tate Modern exhibition about him allowed me to engage with his work more closely. I was especially interested in how he connected with audience through interactive pieces, like the one where the spectator had to press a button for the video to work, and the way he was reinventing an object and using it in a completely new way, like dragging a violin to make sounds instead of playing it. Nevertheless, despite this, I felt something was missing in some of the interactive works. For instance, ‘Three Camera Participation/Participation TV', a piece where three cameras point at the spectator and showcase him/her on a tv, was creating stunning visuals and engaged effectively with people. However, while staring at the queue of people who simply wanted to take a photo of it to most likely post it on social media, I asked myself if I prefer work which carries strong meaning on top of interaction. Therefore, from now onwards my field research will probably follow the route of human-centred design, social design and meaningful tech. </p>
<h3> Final thoughts </h3>
<p>In conclusion, this project has shown me that for me moving image might be a process more than my field. Concept, interactivity, experience and visuals are key concepts which drive my interest and will form my practice, probably situating my field somewhere in between interactive, experiential and social design.</p>
