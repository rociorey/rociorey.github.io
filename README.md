[Insert Spanish accent here] 

Heey, I’m Rocio! A Graphic Comm Design with Creative Computing student at CSM & CCI 〰️

I’m interested in people, their stories, struggles and experiences.
Interactivity is one of the key features of my work.
I aim to create objects and experiences that enhance people’s lives. 

Lately I've been quite interested in physical computing, prototyping with Arduino :)
